# TERAX.md

Terax loads `TERAX.md` from the workspace root as agent memory (similar to AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md). This file is also the project's living architecture doc - read it before making changes.

## Project

**Terax**: open-source AI-native terminal emulator. Tauri 2 + Rust (`portable-pty`) backend, React 19 + TypeScript + libghostty-vt WASM client (WebGPU, Terax WebGL fallback), BYOK AI via Vercel AI SDK v6.

- Bundle id: `app.crynta.terax`
- Package manager: **pnpm**
- Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows
- Frontend checks: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check-types`, `pnpm test`
- Rust checks: `cd src-tauri && cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`, `cd src-tauri && cargo nextest run --locked` (local fallback: `cargo test --locked`)

## Quality bar

Production-grade or it does not ship. Every change is judged against all of these, not just "it works":

- **Correctness**: edge cases, failure modes, concurrent access. No "works for now".
- **Performance**: ultra-lightweight is the product. ~7-8 MB bundle, high-performance terminal. For every change ask: how much RAM it costs, whether it adds IPC round-trips or redundant requests, whether it triggers extra re-renders or wasted work, whether it pulls a heavy dependency. Unused features consume zero resources.
- **Security**: no critical security holes. Validate at every boundary (IPC, fs, network, AI tool surface). The secret-path deny-list applies on both read and write and is never bypassed.
- **UI/UX**: polished, professional, premium. Every state and detail considered.
- **Architecture**: new or changed logic lives in pure, dependency-light functions (functional core); tauri commands and React components stay thin (imperative shell). Keeps it testable without a later rewrite.

Verify before claiming done:

- Frontend: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check-types`, `pnpm test`
- Rust: `cd src-tauri && cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`, `cd src-tauri && cargo nextest run --locked` (or `cargo test --locked`)

A change to a core subsystem (terminal/shell spawn, workspace auth, git, fs, IPC or AI tool surface) needs a test that locks the invariant.

## Terminal migration status

libghostty-vt is the only terminal model. WebGPU is the default renderer and
Terax WebGL is the compatibility fallback. Each leaf owns one persistent model;
presentation resources are shared, bounded, and released for hidden leaves.
Native cell, grapheme and hyperlink presentation buffers allocate on first use
and return to the WASM allocator when presentation is reclaimed. Hidden parsing
does not rebuild them. Short visibility pauses retain uploaded cell data.
Unchanged frames do not acquire presentation textures or draw; cursor-only
updates retain cell buffers. WebGL background and decoration geometry uses
row range uploads while rectangle counts are stable; structural changes rebuild
the compact stream. Scrollbar synchronization reads no DOM on unchanged frames.
Blink timers stop in unfocused windows, and native
cursor hiding stops cursor timers. Selection damages only its old and new rows;
streaming search invalidations coalesce instead of rebuilding per output chunk.
WebGL surface and renderer code load only when selected, needed for fallback,
or explicitly requested by diagnostics. Delayed imports cannot install into a
closed, restarted, or replaced session.
xterm, its addons, CSS, snapshots, session pool, and dormant byte ring are removed.
Unsupported graphics produce a visible error with retry instead of changing models.

Command blocks use parser-time Ghostty tracked pins, including endpoint columns,
so command ranges survive reflow and exclude following prompts and commands.
The native marker ring is capped at 2,048 pins; JavaScript history is capped at
1,000 blocks and 512 KiB of estimated UTF-16 command/cwd text. Block implementation
and UI load only for block sessions, and hidden/occluded block presentation stops.
Block search yields after 128 rows or four milliseconds, retains at most 500
matches, and cancels obsolete queries. Block copy, search, sticky headers, navigation, Ask AI, rerun, shared shell input,
and selection all use the same persistent Ghostty model.
Block chrome commits with its matching renderer frame; command-editor focus does
not lower active-pane cadence. Divider padding is presentation-only and does not
change copied command boundaries. Scrollbars preserve native fractional positions
and ignore delayed programmatic scroll events. Hidden output does no surface DOM
or search-mask work until presentation resumes.

Terminal clipboard shortcuts use the native text clipboard plugin on all desktop
platforms. Context clicks expose the selected text through the input element to
restore the webview's native text menu; no persistent DOM scrollback is maintained.
Unclaimed macOS Command shortcuts reach the native menu after explicit clipboard,
block-editor, and readline bindings, including when Kitty keyboard mode is active.
The block prompt retains an enabled terminal input proxy for native menus and
routes editing keys, composed text and paste back to its command editor.
Character drags retain a native selection pin from pointerdown, including before
the first pointermove. Unmoved clicks and lost captures discard provisional pins.
Key encoding supplies the base character required by Kitty keyboard mode; plain
keys and key releases also use Ghostty encoding when the application requests it.
Terminal text uses the configured font, an installed Nerd Font when detected,
or bundled JetBrains Mono. Private-use prompt symbols require an installed font
that supplies them; Terax does not ship a separate symbol font. Native color
emoji remain on the system fallback path. Rerun requires the complete command
submitted through Terax; truncated shell labels are never executed.
Primary-screen full erase, scrollback erase, and terminal reset invalidate block
pins at parse time and clear block chrome, selection, and search. Commands after
an erase in the same output chunk retain their new pins. Alternate-screen erases
preserve primary block history. Block scrollbar status dots are removed along
with their timers and history scans.

The shared command bar activates after shell integration confirms prompt input.
Bare shells keep direct terminal input. Bash before 4.4 reports
`OSC 133;B;terax_blocks=0` and keeps its native prompt because it lacks PS0.

Settings offer Automatic or WebGL for new terminals, plus opt-in screen reader
output. Accessible text is limited to 256 rows / 64 KiB and refreshes at most four
times per second while visible. Ordinary URL detection runs on pointer demand;
OSC 8 links take precedence. OSC 52 side effects retain one in-flight write and
only the latest pending value across the window.

The adapted Ghostty revision is pinned in `packages/ghostty-core/adapted/UPSTREAM.md`.
Both SIMD and scalar artifacts are shipped; the loader fetches only the variant
the webview supports. Scalar validation explicitly disables SIMD instructions
and types. This avoids changing OS minimums solely for the WASM SIMD requirement;
actual older WKWebView and WebKitGTK compatibility still needs platform tests.

PTY output retains a 2 MiB pending plus in-flight byte limit and two-message
window. Acknowledgments are cumulative parsed-byte offsets validated against
native chunk boundaries, so duplicates and retries cannot grant extra credit.
Parser failures stop delivery visibly without acknowledging unconsumed bytes.
Exit waits for the reader drain and final parsing acknowledgments. Unix readers
sleep on PTY readiness plus an explicit shutdown signal without a polling timer.
After shell exit they consume ready output, bounded to 2 MiB / 30 seconds, rather
than wait indefinitely for an inherited slave descriptor to close. Exceeding this
drain bound reports a reader failure and exit status -1. After shell exit,
30 seconds without acknowledgment progress closes a stalled queue with a logged
delivery failure and exit status -1. The deadline is armed before ConPTY close
and thread joins; it does not run during live-shell backpressure. Close wakes blocked
queue workers and the Unix reader; Windows keeps draining the pipe while ConPTY closes.

Enable release diagnostics with `localStorage.setItem("terax:terminal-diagnostics", "1")`
and reload. `window.__teraxTerm()` reads frontend counters;
`await window.__teraxTermSnapshot()` adds native queue counters and explicitly
labeled host RSS. Host RSS
excludes WebContent and GPU processes and is not total application memory.

Ghostty presentation uses shared native macOS occlusion/sleep and DOM visibility
tracking. It pauses immediately, retains presentation for two seconds during
short desktop transitions, and then reclaims hidden-window GPU resources.
Sleep requests immediate reclamation; hidden tabs still release their leases
immediately. Per-pane pacing prevents focused output from raising background
pane cadence. WebGPU permits at most two outstanding frame submissions.
User wheel, drag, and keyboard interaction gives only its pane 150 ms of focused
cadence, including in an unfocused visible window. It starts no idle timer or
frame loop. Reclaimed WebGPU canvases shrink to 1x1 while retaining their target
geometry for the next presentation transaction.
`window.__teraxTermTrace()` explicitly starts a bounded ten-minute resource trace;
it is never started automatically. `pnpm soak:ghostty` exercises real WASM models
without launching the application. `pnpm profile:ghostty` compares allocation
and parsing workloads in a fresh process per artifact and optional baseline.
Resource evidence and limitations live in
`docs/architecture/ghostty-resource-efficiency.md`.

The release gates and current verification evidence are in
`docs/architecture/ghostty-release-readiness.md`. Automated checks alone do not
establish production readiness, platform parity, or multi-day resource stability.

## Conventions

- **Comments**: default to none, the code should explain itself. If genuinely needed, 1-2 lines on *why*, never *what*. No AI-generic filler.
- **No em-dash** anywhere: code, comments, commits, docs.
- **No emojis** anywhere.
- **Imports**: always `@/...` on the frontend, never relative across modules.
- **pnpm only**, never npm/npx/yarn.

## Architecture

### Two-process model

**Rust (`src-tauri/`)** owns all OS access. The webview never touches the FS, processes, or shells directly - everything goes through `invoke()` calls to commands registered in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`:

- `pty::pty_*` - long-lived interactive PTY sessions (portable-pty ↔ Ghostty), managed by `PtyState` (`RwLock<HashMap<id, Session>>`). Output streams via a Tauri `Channel<PtyEvent>`.
- `fs::tree::*` (`fs_read_dir`, `list_subdirs`), `fs::file::*` (`fs_read_file`, `fs_write_file`, `fs_stat`, `fs_canonicalize`), `fs::mutate::*` (`fs_create_file`, `fs_create_dir`, `fs_rename`, `fs_move`, `fs_delete`, `fs_delete_batch`): file explorer + editor IO.
- `fs::search::*` (`fs_search`, `fs_list_files`), `fs::grep::*` (`fs_grep`, `fs_glob`): fuzzy file finder + content search (powered by `ignore` + `grep-*` crates).
- `git::commands::*`: full source-control surface (`git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_diff_content`, `git_stage`, `git_unstage`, `git_discard`, `git_commit`, `git_fetch`, `git_pull_ff_only`, `git_push`, `git_log`, `git_blame`, `git_show_commit`, `git_commit_files`, `git_commit_file_diff`, `git_panel_snapshot`, `git_resolve_repo`, `git_remote_url`). All gated through the workspace authorization registry.
- `shell::shell_run_command`: one-shot subshell exec used by AI tools. Distinct from PTY sessions; not the user's interactive terminal. On Windows via PowerShell (`-NoProfile -Command`), on Unix via `$SHELL -lc`. Shared helper `build_oneshot_command`.
- `shell::shell_session_*`: persistent agent shell with state across calls. `shell::shell_bg_*` (`spawn`, `logs`, `kill`, `list`): long-running background processes (dev servers etc.) with bounded ring-buffer log capture.
- `workspace::*`: `workspace_authorize` / `workspace_current_dir` (the spawn/git/AI cwd authorization registry) plus the WSL bridge (`wsl_list_distros`, `wsl_default_distro`, `wsl_home`).
- `lsp::*` (`lsp_detect`, `lsp_host_pid`, `lsp_resolve_root`, `lsp_spawn`, `lsp_send`, `lsp_kill`): language server process host. Dumb JSON-RPC pipe: Content-Length framing + process lifecycle in Rust (`lsp/framing.rs`, pure + tested), protocol intelligence on the frontend. Spawn cwd gated through the workspace registry; binaries resolve via the captured login-shell env (`lsp/env.rs`, GUI apps get a bare PATH on macOS); root detection walks up to markers but never to or above `$HOME`. Servers run in their own process group on Unix and are group-killed (cargo check / proc-macro children die with the server); Windows children get a `proc::job::ProcessJob` (kill-on-close, shared with pty). All sessions killed on `RunEvent::Exit`.
- `net::*` (`ai_http_request`, `ai_http_stream`, `lm_ping`): AI HTTP proxy with SSRF guard; keeps provider calls and local-model pings off the webview.
- `secrets::secrets_*`: OS keychain via the `keyring` crate. Service constant `terax-ai`. Linux uses a file-based fallback gated behind `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`.
- `open_settings_window`: separate webview window for Settings (optional `tab` arg deep-links a section).
- `vibrancy::window_*`: native window backdrop (`window_backdrop_kind`, `window_set_backdrop`). macOS gets `NSVisualEffectMaterial::UnderWindowBackground`, Windows 11 gets Mica (gated on build >= 22000 via `RtlGetVersion`, since `apply_mica` fails on Windows 10), Linux reports `none` because blur there belongs to the compositor. The `window-vibrancy` crate is a macOS/Windows-only dependency so Linux builds never pull it.

### PTY shell integration

PTY shells are bootstrapped via injected init scripts in `src-tauri/src/modules/pty/scripts/`:

- **Unix** (`zshenv.zsh`, `zprofile.zsh`, `zlogin.zsh`, `zshrc.zsh`, `bashrc.bash`) for zsh/bash, plus `init.fish` installed to `~/.config/fish/conf.d/terax.fish` for fish. Emit OSC 7 (cwd) and OSC 133 A/B/C/D (prompt boundaries + exit code) so the host can track cwd and detect command boundaries without re-parsing the prompt. Fish 4.0+ writes its own OSC 133 prompt markers; Terax sets `fish_features=no-mark-prompt` and re-asserts its own prompt via `-C` to avoid doubling.
- **Windows** (`profile.ps1`) - passed via `pwsh -NoLogo -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path>`. Wraps the user's existing `prompt` function (after their `$PROFILE` runs) to emit OSC 7 + OSC 133 A/B/D. Shell priority: `pwsh.exe` (PS 7+) → `powershell.exe` (PS 5.1) → `cmd.exe` (no integration). cwd is normalized to backslashes before being passed to ConPTY (`CreateProcessW` misbehaves with forward-slash cwd).

`pty/shell_init.rs` is split into `#[cfg(unix)]` / `#[cfg(windows)]` modules - keep new platform-specific code in the right cfg arm.

ConPTY on Windows requires `CONPTY_LIFECYCLE_LOCK` (Mutex) around `openpty + spawn_command` in `session.rs`. Concurrent spawns leave one of the resulting PTYs with a stalled output pipe. Don't remove the lock without verifying first-tab stability under fast tab spam.

Each ConPTY child is also assigned to a per-session **Job Object** with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` (`pty/job.rs`). When the Job HANDLE drops - clean shutdown, panic, or even SIGKILL'd Terax process - the kernel kills every descendant of the shell (e.g. `npm run dev` spawned from inside pwsh). Without this Windows orphans the entire process subtree because `TerminateProcess` only kills the immediate child. macOS/Linux rely on `Drop for Session → killer.kill()`; on dev-`Ctrl-C` of `cargo run` destructors don't fire and orphans are possible there too - acceptable for now since dev only.

`AiComposerProvider` is mounted unconditionally at the App.tsx root: a conditional wrapper would change the parent element type when keys load, remounting the entire tree (and re-spawning every PTY) the moment `getAllKeys()` resolves. Production happened to dodge this because keychain reads can land in the same paint frame; dev didn't. Keep the unconditional wrap.

### Frontend (`src/`)

Single-window React app. Path alias `@/*` → `src/*`. Tabs are a tagged union (`kind`: `terminal` | `editor` | `preview` | `markdown` | `ai-diff` | `git-diff` | `git-history` | `git-commit-file`) and **not** unmounted on switch - they're hidden via `invisible pointer-events-none` so PTYs and dev servers keep streaming in the background.

`App.tsx` wires modules together - keep it a coordinator. New features go inside the appropriate `modules/<area>/`.

### Module layout (`src/modules/`)

Each module is self-contained, exports a thin barrel via `index.ts`, and owns its hooks under `lib/`.

- **terminal/** - `TerminalStack` keeps live leaves mounted. `useGhosttyTerminalSession` owns one persistent model and PTY per leaf; GPU/WebGL surfaces lease shared presentation resources independently. `terminalSessionApi.ts` exposes renderer-neutral product actions. OSC 7 paths and OSC 52 payloads are validated by pure parsers; Ghostty supplies OSC 133 events and native command anchors to the lazy block controller. WebGPU can fail over to WebGL without replacing the model, PTY, selection, search, or block history. Hidden models keep parsing through bounded PTY transport while presentation is released. There is no snapshot replay or second terminal parser. Theme colors come from the central theme engine.
- **editor/** - CodeMirror 6 stack (`EditorStack` mirrors `TerminalStack`). `extensions.ts` configures language modes; supports vim mode. Buffers live in LF space and the original EOL (`lib/eol.ts`, majority-vote detection) is restored on save; indent unit/tab size are detected per file (`lib/indent.ts`) via a per-pane compartment. Saves are conflict-checked against the disk mtime returned by `fs_read_file`/`fs_write_file` (mismatch → warning toast with explicit Overwrite, never silent last-writer-wins); external format-on-save only applies the disk read-back if the doc is unchanged since the save snapshot. Files over 10 MB offer "Open anyway" (hard cap 50 MB, `force` arg); above 4 MB syntax highlighting and LSP stay off. Cmd-F routes to CodeMirror's own search panel (find/replace/regex) when an editor tab is active, Ctrl-G opens go-to-line; both panels styled in `chromeTheme.ts`. Format-on-save formatters live in `lib/externalFormat.ts` (`FORMATTERS` registry: biome, prettier, ruff, rustfmt, gofmt, clang-format, shfmt, zig fmt, plus a custom `{file}` command template); `resolveFormatter` applies per-language overrides (`editorFormatterByLang`) over the global default, and a global external default only runs on languages its tool understands. Diff panes resolve the language before mounting CodeMirror: a late compartment reconfigure leaves the merge view's deleted-chunk widgets unhighlighted. AI inline completion (`lib/autocomplete/`) sends the buffer's indent unit with the request and normalizes unambiguous tab/space mismatches in responses (`normalizeIndent.ts`); triggering is `autocompleteTrigger` auto or manual, with `editor.aiComplete` / `editor.codeComplete` registry shortcuts (guarded to editor tabs so the keys fall through to terminals), and Tab accepts an open completion popup before the ghost. Multi-line ghosts render first-line-inline plus a block widget below the line (never inline `<br>`s); a closers-only line-suffix (cursor inside `fn(|)`) is hidden and re-appended after the block so the preview equals the accept result, and a line-suffix with real code caps the ghost to one line (`capToLineSuffix`). Suggestions echoing the recent prefix are dropped, multi-line suggestions and closing brackets never start on a line that ends with `;`, and closer-only lines are reindented from the previous line (`trimSuggestion`/`reindentClosers`, all tested). Markdown editing is GFM (`markdownLanguage` base) with fenced-code highlighting resolved through the shared lazy language registry, Cmd/Ctrl+Click URLs, and clickable task checkboxes (`markdownExtras.ts`, all inside the lazy markdown chunk; the eager-budget test enforces this). Dotenv files (`.env`, `.env.*`, and `*.env`) use the lazy shell grammar. Editor theme is decoupled from the app theme: the `editorTheme` pref is `"auto" | EditorThemeId` (default `"auto"`), resolved at render time by `useEditorThemeExt` via `resolveEditorThemeId`. In `auto` the editor follows the active app theme's `editorTheme[mode]` pairing (live, never stale); an explicit pick overrides. Theme ids + labels live in `settings/store.ts` (`EDITOR_THEMES`/`EDITOR_THEME_LABELS`); the matching extensions in `editor/lib/themes.ts` (`EDITOR_THEME_EXT`). Prebuilt `@uiw` themes plus locally-built ones in `editor/lib/cmThemes.ts` (Kanagawa wave/lotus/dragon, Everforest, Dracula, Solarized, Catppuccin, Rosé Pine) via `createTheme` (no extra deps). The three CM surfaces (`EditorPane`, `AiDiffPane`, `GitDiffPane`) all read the theme through `useEditorThemeExt`.
  Inline git blame (`editorInlineBlame`, off by default) annotates the cursor's line with the last commit that touched it (`lib/blame.ts` + `lib/useInlineBlame.ts`, own compartment so it costs nothing while disabled). Blame is line-indexed against the file on disk, so a dirty buffer shows no annotations until the save refetches, and answers that land after an edit are dropped; hidden tabs and non-repo files never spawn a git process. External changes refetch through the same `fs:changed` event the editor already watches. `git blame` is bounded with `-L` and results are capped at 20,000 lines in Rust.
  Editor code size is stored separately as `editorFontSize` and does not affect `terminalFontSize`.
- **explorer/** - file tree with Material/Catppuccin icons (`iconResolver.ts`), fuzzy search, keyboard nav, inline rename, context actions. Backslash-aware `basename`.
- **preview/** - auto-detected dev-server preview tab (status-bar pill suggests opening when a localhost URL is detected).
- **tabs/** - `useTabs` is the source of truth for tab list + active id. `useWorkspaceCwd` derives explorer root + inherited cwd for new tabs from active tab. `basename` splits on both `/` and `\`.
- **header/** - top bar + inline search (`SearchInline` adapts to terminal vs editor via `SearchTarget`). `WindowControls` rendered when `USE_CUSTOM_WINDOW_CONTROLS` is true (Linux + Windows; macOS uses native traffic lights).
- **statusbar/** - bottom bar, `CwdBreadcrumb` (handles Unix paths, Windows drive letters, and home `~` segments via `pathUtils.segmentsFromCwd`), AI tools indicator.
- **shortcuts/** - keymap registry (`shortcuts.ts`) + `useGlobalShortcuts`. Handlers live in `App.tsx` and are passed in by id (`tab.new`, `ai.toggle`, …). `metaKey || ctrlKey` for cross-platform Cmd/Ctrl.
- **settings/** - settings store (`store.ts` via `tauri-plugin-store`), preferences hook, settings window opener.
- **sidebar/** - activity bar + collapsible side panels (explorer, source control, git history).
- **source-control/** - git status / stage / commit panel and diff workflow.
- **git-history/** - commit graph rail, refs, per-commit file diffs.
- **lsp/** - opt-in language server support, zero cost until enabled (no process, no PATH check, nothing in the eager bundle beyond a 14.5 kB shell). Statusbar pill offers Enable (binary found) or Install (with copyable command) per language; activation persists as `lspActivation` in the settings store (`enabled`/`dismissed`/unset). `sessionManager.ts` keys sessions by (server, workspace root), refcounts open docs, idle-kills after 3 min, and crash-backoffs (cooldown before respawn; 3 in 5 min → give up + toast with the server's stderr tail). Resource invariants: **no root marker → no session** (a dirname fallback once spawned a server per directory and burned GBs), hard cap of 4 sessions per server, lean per-preset `initializationOptions` (rust-analyzer: `cachePriming` off + bounded `lru`; tsls: `maxTsServerMemory`). Client is `codemirror-languageserver` behind a lazy import, subclassed (`lib/client.ts`) to add didClose/didSave/shutdown, `textDocument/references` (Shift-F12; multi-result definitions and references share the `locationsPanel.ts` picker) and the publishDiagnostics capability the lib forgets (tsls sends no diagnostics without it); `lib/transport.ts` bridges to the Rust pipe and answers server-to-client requests the lib ignores. `vscode-languageserver-protocol` is aliased to a 4-enum shim in vite.config.ts (~117 kB saved). Presets: typescript, rust-analyzer, pyright, ruff, gopls and more; custom stdio servers via Settings. Several presets can claim one language (pyright and ruff both take `py`): `serverForLanguage` prefers the enabled candidate, so enabling ruff while pyright is unset or dismissed routes Python to ruff. WSL workspaces excluded for now.
- **markdown/** - markdown preview renderer (backs the `markdown` tab kind).
- **workspace/** - workspace environment switching (Local + WSL distros).
- **theme/** - custom theme engine (no `next-themes`). `ThemeProvider` + `applyTheme` write CSS variables; built-in presets in `themes/` (terax-default - colours live in `globals.css` since ThemeProvider clears rather than applies for that id - xcode, claude, kanagawa, kanagawa-dragon, tokyo-night, catppuccin, rose-pine, everforest, nord, gruvbox, dracula, solarized, tide, sage, caffeine), each optionally declaring an `editorTheme` pairing consumed by `resolveEditorThemeId` (see editor/). User themes via `customThemes.ts` + `validateTheme.ts`, optional background image via `bgImageStore.ts` + `SurfaceLayer`.
- **updater/** - auto-updater UI built on `tauri-plugin-updater`.
- **agents/** - agent launching, notifications, and management for both the built-in Terax agent and terminal coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Pi, OpenCode, Grok). The header launcher (`components/AgentLauncherPanel.tsx` + `lib/launcher.ts`) persists per-agent start commands in preferences and atomically builds balanced one-to-four-pane tabs. Shared store (`store/agentStore.ts`: terminal `sessions` + `localAgent` + `notifications`) and a shared router (`lib/route.ts`: suppress when focused-and-visible, OS-notify when unfocused, in-app Sonner toast when focused-but-hidden) feed the header `NotificationBell` (management surface, Terax agent listed first, per-agent hook enable rows). Toasts use Sonner (`components/ui/sonner.tsx`) themed via the central engine; `lib/agentIcon.tsx` renders the per-agent brand mark. Terminal detection is Rust-side (`pty/agent_detect.rs`) on the PTY reader's byte filter, armed on `OSC 133;C;<cmd>` or self-armed by the marker, emitting `terax:agent-signal` transitions (`started`/`working`/`attention`/`finished`/`exited`) driven only by OSC sequences (never raw output, so a repainting TUI never flaps) - zero cost when no agent runs. Hook-backed terminal agents converge on the same `OSC 777` marker the detector reads, installed via `agent_enable_hooks(agent)` / `agent_hooks_status(agent)` in `modules/agent.rs` (data-driven `AgentSpec` for JSON-hook agents plus a Terax-owned Pi extension; atomic writes, foreign configuration preserved, idempotent; gated on `TERAX_TERMINAL`). OpenCode and Grok use OSC 133 process-lifecycle detection but do not install attention hooks. Delivery differs because only Claude's hook protocol can return terminal bytes in the hook *response*: **Claude** (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `UserPromptSubmit`/`Notification`/`Stop`) returns the marker via the `terminalSequence` field (legacy 3-field `notify;Terax;<event>`). **Codex** (`~/.codex/hooks.json`, `UserPromptSubmit`/`PermissionRequest`/`Stop`) and **Gemini** (`~/.gemini/settings.json`, `BeforeAgent`/`Notification`/`AfterAgent`, `matcher:"*"`) can't, so the hook *command* emits the 4-field `notify;Terax;<agent>;<event>` marker itself (`printf > /dev/tty` on Unix, or `terax __terax_notify` writing to `CONOUT$` after `AttachConsole` on Windows) and prints `{}` as a JSON stdout no-op (Codex's `Stop` and Gemini both reject empty/non-JSON stdout). **Pi** (`~/.pi/agent/extensions/terax-notifications.ts`) uses `agent_start`/`agent_settled` extension events and writes its named marker directly to stdout. The agent-named marker lets a self-arm name the right agent when no preexec fired (bash/tmux/Windows). The Terax agent path is `ai/components/LocalAgentNotificationsBridge.tsx`, mapping `chatStore.agentMeta` (`awaiting-approval`→attention, busy→idle→finished, `error`) into the same router.
- **command-palette/** - modal command palette (`CommandPalette.tsx`, `commands.ts`) for actions and navigation.
- **spaces/** - workspace spaces/projects (name, root, env, color, per-space tab persistence) via `useSpaces` and `SpaceSwitcher`.
- **ai/** - see below.

### AI subsystem (`src/modules/ai/`)

BYOK. Cloud providers via `@ai-sdk/*`: **OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Cerebras, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, OpenRouter**, plus **OpenAI-compatible** for any custom base URL. Local / offline providers (key-optional, model id supplied at runtime): **LM Studio, MLX, Ollama**. Provider list in `config.ts` (`PROVIDERS`); model registry includes `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` + `DEFAULT_AUTOCOMPLETE_MODEL`.

- **Key storage**: OS keychain via `keyring` (Rust). Frontend reads/writes through `secrets_*` commands. Service `KEYRING_SERVICE = "terax-ai"`. Never persist keys to disk, settings store, or `localStorage`.
- **Agent** (`lib/agent.ts`): `Experimental_Agent` with `stopWhen: stepCountIs(MAX_AGENT_STEPS)` and the system prompt from `config.ts`. Provider branching happens here - keep the `Agent` / `DirectChatTransport` shape; the rest of the system depends on AI SDK v6 chat semantics.
- **Sub-agents** (`agents/registry.ts`, `agents/runSubagent.ts`): named sub-agents with their own system prompts and tool subsets, invoked by the main agent via `run_subagent` tool.
- **Sessions** (`lib/sessions.ts` + `store/chatStore.ts`): conversations are organized into named sessions, persisted via `tauri-plugin-store` at `terax-ai-sessions.json` (list + `activeId` + per-session `messages:<id>` keys). `chatStore.ts` keeps a module-scoped `Map<sessionId, Chat<UIMessage>>`; `getOrCreateChat(apiKey, sessionId)` lazily constructs a `Chat`, seeded with messages from a hydration map populated by `hydrateSessions()` (called once from `App.tsx`). `AgentRunBridge` mirrors active-session messages to disk on every change and auto-derives titles from the first user message. Switching the API key wipes the chat map; sessions persist.
- **Composer** (`lib/composer.tsx`): React context providing shared input state (text, attachments, voice) for both the docked `AiInputBar` and any other surface. Attachments include image, text-file, and `selection` kinds - selections come from `useChatStore.attachSelection(text, source)` (drained into chips, not pasted into the textarea) and are wrapped as `<selection source="terminal|editor">…</selection>` blocks at submit. Composer derives `isBusy` from `agentMeta.status` so it can mount safely before sessions hydrate.
- **Voice input**: streamed transcription pipeline. Toggled from the composer.
- **Live context bridge**: `App.tsx` calls `setLive({ getCwd, getTerminalContext, … })` so tools can read the *currently active* terminal's cwd + last 300 lines of buffer. Lazy by design - don't pre-snapshot.
- **Tools** (`tools/tools.ts`): `read_file`, `list_directory`, `fs_search`, `fs_grep` auto-execute. `write_file`, `create_directory`, `rename`, `delete`, `run_command`, `shell_session_run`, `shell_bg_spawn` set `needsApproval: true` and the AI SDK pauses for an in-UI confirmation card. Auto-send after approval uses `lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithApprovalResponses`. `lib/security.ts` is a deny-list refusing obvious secret paths (`.env*`, `.ssh/`, credentials, keychain dirs) - apply on **both** read and write paths and don't bypass it.
- **Edit diffs**: AI-proposed edits open in a side-by-side diff tab (`ai-diff` tab kind); user accepts/rejects per hunk before the write tool actually runs.
- **Prompt snippets** (`#handle`): reusable prompt fragments surfaced in the composer. Do not describe these as skills; a reusable tool-bundled skills system is not implemented yet.

### UI conventions

- **shadcn/ui** is configured (`components.json`, style `radix-luma`, base `mist`, icon lib **hugeicons**). Primitives in `src/components/ui/` - don't hand-edit; re-run `pnpm dlx shadcn add` to upgrade.
- **AI Elements** (Vercel) live in `src/components/ai-elements/` from the `@ai-elements` registry in `components.json`. Same rule: regenerate, don't hand-patch - composition wrappers belong in `modules/ai/components/`.
- **Tailwind v4** - no `tailwind.config.*`, config is in `src/App.css` via `@theme`. Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils`.
- Animation: `motion` (Framer Motion successor). Resizable layout: `react-resizable-panels`.
- **Window vibrancy**: the `windowVibrancy` pref drives `WindowVibrancyBridge` (main window only - `window_set_backdrop` targets its caller). `html[data-vibrancy="on"]` makes `<html>`/`<body>` transparent and redefines `--frame` with alpha, so only the chrome frosts; panes keep `--background` so terminal text stays on a solid surface and the terminal canvas still matches its container. The opaque colour the pre-paint script parks on `<html>` would cover the backdrop, so `applyVibrancy` clears it while the effect is on; there is deliberately no localStorage fast path, since pre-declaring the effect would show a see-through window on any launch where the native call has not landed yet. Repeat applications are deduped, and only Mica is rebuilt on a light/dark flip (NSVisualEffectView adapts on its own).
- **Floating panes**: header and status bar are window chrome painted on `--frame` (derived from `--card`, so no theme declares it); the sidebar and the tab surface are `.terax-pane` cards on `--background` - same tone as the terminal canvas. Panes meet the chrome flush and are inset only horizontally, because the header centers its content and any vertical gutter would stack onto that padding and read as asymmetric. `.terax-pane` carries no drop shadow: `react-resizable-panels` clips panel content at the panel box, so a shadow would only render on the gutter sides.
- Path imports: always `@/…`, never relative across modules.
- Cross-platform paths: anywhere a path may originate from OSC 7, the explorer, or the OS, normalize separators with `.split(/[\\/]/)` rather than `.split("/")`.
- Canonical path form on the frontend is **forward-slash**. `homeDir()` returns backslashes on Windows; convert at the boundary (App.tsx setHome). OSC 7 already arrives as forward-slash. Equal canonical strings keep `useFileTree` from wiping its tree and flashing the explorer when `tab.cwd` first arrives.

### Window styling

- macOS: `titleBarStyle: Overlay` + `hiddenTitle: true` in `tauri.conf.json` (native traffic lights via overlay). `transparent: true` + `macOSPrivateApi: true` in `tauri.conf.json` are what `NSVisualEffectView` requires; that also means the macOS build uses a private API and is not App Store eligible.
- Linux: `decorations: false` + `transparent: true` from `tauri.linux.conf.json`; re-asserted post-realize for GNOME/Mutter CSD.
- Windows: same as Linux via `tauri.windows.conf.json`. React renders custom `WindowControls`.

### Tauri capabilities

`src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` is the allowlist for plugin APIs available to the webview. New plugins (dialog, autostart, updater, window-state, store, opener, os, log are wired in `lib.rs`) typically need:
1. `Cargo.toml` dependency
2. `.plugin(...)` call in `lib.rs` `run()`
3. capability entry in `default.json`

### Cross-platform conventions

- HOME / cache dirs: use the `dirs` crate (`dirs::home_dir()`, `dirs::cache_dir()`), never raw `$HOME` / `%USERPROFILE%`.
- Shell init scripts: gate Unix-only logic behind `#[cfg(unix)]`; Windows arm in `pty::shell_init::windows`.
- Terminal input: send `\r` (CR) for Enter, not `\n` (LF) - PowerShell on Windows requires CR.

### Bundle config

- `bundle.targets: "all"` plus per-platform sections in `tauri.conf.json`:
  - **macOS**: `minimumSystemVersion: 13.0`.
  - **Linux**: deb depends `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0`, `libgtk-3-0`; rpm `webkit2gtk4.1`, `gtk3`; AppImage bundles its media framework.
  - **Windows**: NSIS installer in `currentUser` mode (no admin required), WebView2 via `downloadBootstrapper`. Installing a missing WebView2 runtime requires internet access; there is no bundled offline runtime. Packaged and offline-install validation remains in the release-readiness gates.
- Auto-updater configured with a public minisign key; release artifacts at `https://github.com/crynta/terax-ai/releases/latest/download/latest.json`.
- `bundle.resources` includes the upstream Ghostty, Restty, ghostty-web, and xterm.js license notices under `licenses/terminal/`. Repository documentation and test-only reference WASM cores are not packaged; the frontend includes only the adapted SIMD and scalar cores.

### Known gotchas

- **React 19 strict mode** double-mounts `useEffect` in dev → terminals spawn twice on first render. The first PTY is cleaned up almost immediately. The `CONPTY_LIFECYCLE_LOCK` mutex serializes this; don't be alarmed by `pty opened id=1` followed by `pty closed id=1` in dev logs.
- **Windows PowerShell process lifecycle**: `killer.kill()` from `portable-pty` only kills the immediate child. Descendants (e.g. `npm run dev` started inside pwsh) survive unless something else takes them down. The Job Object in `pty/job.rs` handles this for the Terax-process-death case; an explicit `pty_close` from JS also kills only the immediate child + relies on the Job to take the rest. Don't disable the Job without a replacement.
- **Tab `cwd` storage**: comes from OSC 7 with forward slashes (after `parseOsc7` strips `/C:` → `C:`). Anything that consumes `tab.cwd` and passes it to a Rust fs command on Windows must normalize separators or accept both forms - `apply_common` in `pty::shell_init` handles this for PTY spawn; other call sites must do their own.
